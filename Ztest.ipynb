As I understand this, each study provides a sample of the true (unkown) parent population of the global thicknesses of ice. What we can do is measure the error of the means, and the error between samples, but we cannot compare sample to the population. If we have truly randomly sampled the parent population, then there should be no significant differences among the sample means that we have obtained.\n",
