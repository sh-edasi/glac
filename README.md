# glac
A machine learning approach to predicting mountain glacier thicknesses.

The Glacier Thickness Predictor (GTP) is divided into four sections: sm, sm2, sm4, sm5

sm:
training data - glacier.csv


sm2:
training data - Glam
Glam was built from T.csv and RGI_assembly


sm4:
training data - Glam_phys
Glam_phys was Glam dropped centroid lat and lon

sm5:
training data - Glam_2
Glam_2 rebuilt Glam with more rigor. Each matched index was recorded and selected for lowest distance away.
